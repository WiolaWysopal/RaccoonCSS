    <p>Long ago, in Ireland, there lived a great warrior and poet named Oisín, son of the legendary leader of the Fianna, Fionn mac Cumhaill. One day, as he wandered through the green hills, he saw before him a beautiful woman on a white horse. She had golden hair, and her eyes shone like stars.
    
        She was Niamh of the Golden Hair, a princess from Tír na nÓg—the Land of Eternal Youth, where no one ages or dies.<br>

        "I have come for you, Oisín," she said in a gentle voice. "If you come with me, you will know happiness and eternal youth."<br>
        
        Oisín, enchanted by her beauty, mounted the white horse, which immediately carried them over the waves of the sea. They soon arrived in Tír na nÓg, a wondrous land where suffering, sorrow, and death did not exist. Oisín lived there happily for many years, but eventually, he longed for Ireland and wished to see his homeland and his old companions from the Fianna. <br>
        
        Niamh warned him: <br>
        
        "You may return, but you must not dismount from our horse. If your feet touch the ground, you will never be able to return to Tír na nÓg." <br>
        
        Oisín promised to be careful. When he reached Ireland, he did not recognize his homeland. The villages had changed, castles had crumbled into ruins, and his former companions were gone. The people he met were small and weak, and he could not find anyone who remembered the Fianna.<br>
        
        Then, he saw a group of men struggling to lift a heavy stone. Without hesitation, he bent down to help them. But at that moment, his stirrup broke, and Oisín fell to the ground. Instantly, he aged into an old man—every year that had not touched him in Tír na nÓg caught up with him all at once.<br>
        
        Before he died, he told his story to the monks, who wrote down his tale so it would never be forgotten.<br>
        
        And so, Oisín, who had known eternal youth in the magical land, ultimately died as a mortal in his beloved Ireland.<br></p>
